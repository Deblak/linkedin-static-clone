# LinkedIn Static Clone

A responsive static replica of the LinkedIn 2024 interface, built as an integration exercise.

**Goal:** Reproduce the layout and structure using HTML5, Bootstrap 5 (CDN), and some custom CSS.

I started by designing a zoning of the page, then translated it into colored layout blocks.  
The structure was built mobile-first, and progressively refined until reaching the final result.
